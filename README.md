# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nettest.git
cd nettest

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Install globally (optional)
cargo install --path .
```

### Using Cargo

```bash
# Install directly from source (when published)

```

### Requirements

- Rust 1.70 or later
- Root/administrator privileges may be required for:
  - ICMP ping tests
  - Raw socket operations
  - Some MTU discovery operations

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Run comprehensive tests on a target
nettest full google.com

# Test TCP connectivity
nettest network tcp google.com --port 80

# Test UDP connectivity  
nettest network udp 8.8.8.8 --port 53

# Ping test
nettest network ping google.com --count 4

# Test common ports
nettest network ports google.com --protocol tcp

# DNS query
nettest dns query google.com --record-type a

# Test DNS servers
nettest dns servers google.com

# Test domain categories
nettest dns categories --category normal

# MTU discovery
nettest mtu discover google.com

# Test common MTU sizes
nettest mtu common google.com
```

### Advanced Options

```bash
# Specify IP version
nettest network tcp google.com --ip-version v4
nettest network tcp google.com --ip-version v6
nettest network tcp google.com --ip-version both

# Custom timeout
nettest --timeout 10 network tcp google.com

# JSON output
nettest --json dns query google.com

# Verbose logging
nettest --verbose full google.com

# DNS query with specific server
nettest dns query google.com --server 8.8.8.8:53 --tcp

# Custom MTU range
nettest mtu range google.com --min 1000 --max 1500
```

### Domain Category Testing

Test different categories of domains to analyze DNS filtering:

```bash
# Test normal websites
nettest dns categories --category normal

# Test ad networks
nettest dns categories --category ads

# Test all categories
nettest dns categories --category all

# DNS filtering effectiveness
nettest dns filtering

# Show system DNS configuration
nettest dns debug
```

### DNS Sinkhole Detection

NetTest automatically detects when domains are being sinkholed (redirected to special IP addresses):

```bash
# Example output showing sinkhole detection
$ nettest dns query blocked-domain.com --record-type a
PASS DNS A query for blocked-domain.com (UDP) (45ms)
  ‚úì A records: üï≥Ô∏è SINKHOLED (security success): Redirected to sinkhole IPs: 0.0.0.0

# Example showing missing records (not an error)
$ nettest dns query image.example.com --record-type mx  
PASS DNS MX query for image.example.com (UDP) (32ms)
  ‚úì MX records: (none - no mail servers configured)
```

### Comprehensive Testing

The `full` command runs a comprehensive suite of tests:

```bash
# Full test suite for a domain
nettest full example.com

# Full test with specific IP version
nettest full example.com --ip-version v4
```

This includes:
- TCP and UDP connectivity tests
- ICMP ping tests  
- MTU discovery
- DNS resolution tests
- DNS server tests

## Output Formats

### Human-readable (default)
Colored, formatted output suitable for terminal viewing.

### JSON
Machine-readable JSON output for integration with other tools:

```bash
nettest --json dns query google.com
```


## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
# Unit tests
cargo test

# Integration tests
cargo test --test integration_tests

# All tests with verbose output
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

## Architecture

NetTest is built with a modular architecture for maintainability and extensibility:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cli/          # Command-line interface and argument parsing  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ network/      # Network connectivity testing
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ icmp.rs   # ICMP ping tests with IPv6 support
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tcp.rs    # TCP connection testing
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ udp.rs    # UDP connectivity testing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dns/          # DNS testing and analysis
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ categories.rs  # Domain category definitions
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ queries.rs     # DNS query implementations  
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mod.rs         # Core DNS logic with sinkhole detection
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mtu/          # MTU discovery and testing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/        # Common utilities and error handling
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.rs       # Application entry point and orchestration
```

### Key Design Principles

- **Async-first**: All network operations are asynchronous for better performance
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error handling with descriptive messages
- **Cross-platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows
- **IPv6 ready**: Full support for IPv6 alongside IPv4
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new test types and protocols

## Security Considerations

This tool is designed for defensive security testing and network diagnostics. It:

- Tests legitimate connectivity to verify network functionality
- Analyzes DNS filtering effectiveness
- Discovers network path characteristics
- Does not attempt to exploit or attack systems
- Respects rate limits and timeouts
